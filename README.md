The intent of this project is to provide a generic controller for a garden.
The idea is to allow any hardware (e.g. Arduino, Beaglebone, etc) to be used with any supported set of sensors in order to automate growing plants in a home garden.
In an ideal world, this project could be used in households and communities world-wide to provide food with minimal human effort.
